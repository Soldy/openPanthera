# openPanthera

## About

Open Panthera is an SQL builder and migration tool. \
Panthera is not new. Not a revolution. \
That solution is popular in banks and mission-critical systems. But most of the similar tools are the close source. \
The primary logic is simple: The outside client only calls the inbuild functions and procedures. So the system SQL injection prof and easily portable to other technologies. \
The benefits:
   1. Can be safe like an ORM.
   2. Unlike an ORM not stacked with one programing language.
   3. Panthera logic has some performance benefits as well.



Panthera has four versions.
   1. Open Panthera is an easy-to-use open-source implementation built in python. Almost ready to use.
   2. Noname Panthera a nodejs implementation. (Working in Progress)
   3. PHP Panthera.
   4. Sweet Panthera is a closed-source implementation. Fully operational.
