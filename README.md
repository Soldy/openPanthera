# openPanthera

## About

Open Panthera is an SQL builder and migration tool. \
It's a different approach from the most popular ways. \
The outside client is only allowed to call the inbuild functions and procedures.
 - That way can be safe like an ORM.
 - But unlike an ORM not stacked with one programing language.
 - This way has some performance benefits as well.
Panthera is not new. Not a revolution. \
That solution is popular in banks and mission-critical systems. But most of the similar tools are the close source. 


Panthera has four versions.
   1. Open Panthera is an easy-to-use open-source implementation built in python. Almost ready to use.
   2. Noname Panthera a nodejs implementation. (Working in Progress)
   3. PHP Panthera.
   4. Sweet Panthera is a closed-source implementation. Fully operational.
