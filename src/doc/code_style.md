Every help, extension, and fix is welcome. But I have some requirements. 

Please do not use string format. Even if more readable. The reason behind this is my code analytic tools. This tool helps me to compare the Rust, Python, PHP, Javascript, and Typescript versions. Speed up the development. But not close to perfect. Format and regular expression implementation are not supported. Just require too much time that I do not have.

+4 space block indentation.

No Threats. The Panthera feeding the RMDBS server. The database and table creation performance differences are marginal. The data migration performance benefit is significant. However, the risk of an accidental mistake is too high.

Design pattern: The original was agent base + superclass, but refactored to composite.

Please excuse me if I do not have time to check the change immediately. I have 20 minutes each day to work with the Panthera, and the RUST version has priority.
